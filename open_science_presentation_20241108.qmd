## Where is citizen science?

## What is Open Science?

> Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific
> research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists
> and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that
> scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that
> knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable @unesco2023about

## What is Citizen Science?

> Open science opens the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation
> and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific
> community @unesco2023about

- Synonyms: community science, crowd science, crowd-sourced science,
  civic science, participatory monitoring, volunteer monitoring

## Citizen Science features @gura2013citizen

-   obtain data otherwise impossible to get
-   volunteers are gratis
-   managing volunteers takes time
-   projects engage the public in science
-   difficult to guarantee the quality of the data
-   harder peer review

## Citizen Science and Open Science

Working definition 1:

All Citizen Science is part of Open Science.

# The importance of Citizen Science

## Qualitative indicators

> Citizen science can help researchers to address previously insolvable
> problems. @gura2013citizen
>
> Citizen science can also educate and engage @gura2013citizen

## Quantitative indicators

-   Financially: how much money is saved?
-   Academic: how many papers use citizen science?
-   Chance of success: how often does a citizen science project result in a publication?
-   Engagement: how many people are reached?

Back-of-the-envelope calculations!

## The financial impact of Citizen Science

| Value (M\$) | \# projects | Source              |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1.55        | 7           | @sauermann2015crowd |
| 667-2500    | 388         | @theobald2015global |

-   Per project: 0.022-6.4 M\$

## The financial impact of Citizen Science is small

Assuming Citizen Science adds 2.5 B\$:

| Area  | Science budget spending (B\$) | 2.5 B\$ |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------|
| EU    | 408.322 @oecd                 | 0.61%   |
| USA   | 761.582 @oecd                 | 0.33%   |
| World | 1707.221 @oecd                | 0.15%   |

Citizen Science adds 0.15% extra value

## Citizen science is used in few publications 

Citizen science is used in few publications @sauermann2015crowd

![Sauermann & Franzoni, 2015, figure 4](sauermann_and_franzoni_2015_fig_4.jpg)

## Citizen Science projects resulting in a paper

12% of Citizen Science projects can be linked to a peer-reviewed paper @sauermann2015crowd

## Citizen science results in less papers

| Project type    | Chance project can be linked to a publication |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Citizen Science | 12% @sauermann2015crowd                       |
| Open Access     | 61% @hecker2018european                       |
| Closed access   | 21% @hecker2018european                       |

## Is all citizen science open science?

No, from @groom2017citizen:

| Type of data | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| Open         | 11.4%     |
| Closed       | 0.6%      |
| Unclear      | 88%       |

> n = 12458 citizen science projects

## Relation between the two

Working definition 2:

All Citizen Science is part of Open Science, when it produces Open Data

NB: Only Open Access publications?

## Engagement: how many people are reached?

In 2015, 1.36-2.28 million people volunteer annually @theobald2015global

## Engagement: how many people are reached?

| Year | Parameter          | Value                                   |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2014 | Citizens           | 2.28 million @theobald2015global        |
| 2018 | Scientist density  | 1368 per million @unesco2021researchers |
| 2018 | World population   | 7684 million @worldometers              |
| 2018 | Scientists         | 10.51 million                           |

-   There is 1 citizen per 4.6 scientists

# Why UNESCO interested?

## Method

Search UNESCO website why Citizen Science is important

-   e.g. <https://eu-citizen.science/>

## Results

Nothing new.

# Number revisited

## Number revisited: engagement

- 1 citizen per 4.6 scientists
- 0.15% of scientists is a citizen scientist @sauermann2015crowd
- Hence, 307 citizens per 1 citizen scientist

# Number revisited: financial impact

- 0.15% of scientists is a citizen scientist @sauermann2015crowd
- Assuming citizen science adds 2.5 B\$:

| Area  | Science budget spending (B\$) [1] | 2.5 B\$ |
|-------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| EU    | 0.61 @oecd                        | 409.8%  |
| USA   | 1.14 @oecd                        | 219.3%  |
| World | 2.56 @oecd                        | 97.6%   |

- [1] On these 0.15%

A citizen scientist creates a dataset worth
as much as the funding spent on him/her.

# Conclusion 1/3

RQ1: What is the relation between Citizen Science and Open Science?

A: Citizen Science is part of Open Science, if it produces Open Data

# Conclusion 2/3

RQ2: How important is Citizen Science?

-   its overall financial impact is small
-   its financial impact per citizen scientist is big
-   its overall engagement with the public is small
-   its engagement per scientist is big
-   is used in few publications
-   results in less papers per project

# Conclusion 3/3

RQ3: Why is UNESCO interested in it?

- Can only guess
- Engagement?
- Inclusiveness?
- Money?
