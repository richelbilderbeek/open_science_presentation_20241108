## What is Open Science?

Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. @unesco2023about

## How does Open Science look like?

Open science @unesco2023about:

- increases scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society;
- makes multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone; and
- opens the processes of **scientific knowledge creation, evaluation** and communication to **societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community**.
    
## What is Citizen Science?

'Open science opens the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and
communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific
community' @unesco2023about

## Relation between the two

## Is all citizen science open science?

Not all citizen science projects produce open data (n = 12458 citizen science projects): @groom2017citizen
