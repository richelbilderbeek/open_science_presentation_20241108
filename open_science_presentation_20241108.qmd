## What is Open Science?

Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. @unesco2023about

## How does Open Science look like?

Open science @unesco2023about:

-   increases scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society;
-   makes multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone; and
-   opens the processes of **scientific knowledge creation, evaluation** and communication to **societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community**.

## What is Citizen Science?

'Open science opens the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community' @unesco2023about

- Synonyms: community science, crowd science, crowd-sourced science, civic science, participatory monitoring, volunteer monitoring

## Relation between the two

Working definition 1:

All Citizen Science is part of Open Science.

# The importance of Citizen Science

## Indicators

- Financially: how much money is saved?
- Academic: how many papers use citizen science?
- Chance of success:
  how often does a citizen science project result in a publication?
- Engagement: how many people are reached?

## The financial impact of Citizen Science

Value (M\$)|\# projects|Source
-----------|-----------|-------------------
1.55       |7          |@sauermann2015crowd
667-2500   |388        |@theobald2015global

- Per project: 0.022-6.4 M\$

## The financial impact of Citizen Science is small

Assuming citizen science adds 2.5 B$:

Area |Science budget spending (B\$)|2.5 B\$
-----|-----------------------------|----------
EU   |408.322 @oecd                |0.61%
USA  |761.582 @oecd                |0.33%
World|1707.221 @oecd               |0.15

## Citizen science is used in few publications

Citizen science is used in few publications

![Sauermann & Franzoni, 2015, figure 4](sauermann_and_franzoni_2015_fig_4.jpg)

## Citizen Science projects resulting in a paper

12% of Citizen Science projects can be linked to a
peer-reviewed paper @sauermann2015crowd

## Citizen science results in less papers

Project type   |Chance project can be linked to a publication
---------------|---------------------------------------------
Citizen Science|12% @sauermann2015crowd
Open Access    |61% @hecker2018european
Closed access  |21% @hecker2018european

## Is all citizen science open science?

No, from @groom2017citizen:

Type of data|Frequency
------------|---------
Open        |11.4%
Closed      |0.6%
Unclear     |88%

> n = 12458 citizen science projects

## Relation between the two

Working definition 2:

All Citizen Science is part of Open Science, when it produces Open Data

## Engagement: how many people are reached?

In 2015, 1.36-2.28 million people volunteer annually @theobald2015global

## Engagement: how many people are reached?


Year|Parameter         |Value
----|------------------|-----------------
2014|Citizen Scientists|2.28 million @theobald2015global
2018|Scientist density |1368 per million @unesco2021researchers
2018|World population  |7684 million @worldometers 
2018|Scientists        |10.51 million

- There is 1 citizen scientist per 4.6 scientists

# Why UNESCO interested?

## Method

Search UNESCO website why Citizen Science is important

- EU-Citizen.Science: <https://eu-citizen.science/>
 
 
- 'Citizen science can help researchers to address previously insoluble problems'
  @gura2013citizen
- 'Citizen science can also educate and engage' @gura2013citizen
- '“Citizen science is enormously expensive in terms of time and effort managing people, websites and databases,” says [Philip] Brohan' @gura2013citizen. 'People management is one of greatest challenges, says Andrea Wiggins' @gura2013citizen
- it is difficult to guarantee the quality of the data @gura2013citizen
- there is the challenge of getting citizen-science data through peer review @gura2013citizen


## Conclusion

Citizen Science ...

- is part of Open Science
- its financial impact is small
- is used in few publications
- results in less papers per project
