# This talk's research questions

-   RQ1: What is the relation between Citizen Science and Open Science?
-   RQ2: How important is Citizen Science?
-   RQ3: Why is UNESCO interested in it?

## What is Open Science? @unesco2023about

![@unesco2022understanding](unesco2022understanding.png)

## Where is citizen science? @unesco2023about

![@unesco2022understanding](unesco2022understanding_zoom.png)

## What is Open Science?

> Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make
> scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits
> of scientists and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not
> only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that **the production**
> **of that knowledge itself is inclusive**, equitable and sustainable @unesco2023about

## What is Citizen Science?

> Citizen science [...] is research conducted with participation
> from the general public, or amateur/nonprofessional researchers
> or participants for science, social science
> and many other disciplines. vohland2021science

- Synonyms: community science, crowd science, crowd-sourced science, civic science, participatory monitoring, or volunteer monitoring

## Citizen Science features @gura2013citizen

-   obtain data otherwise impossible to get
-   volunteers are free (as in beer)
-   managing volunteers takes time
-   projects engage the public in science
-   difficult to guarantee the quality of the data
-   harder peer review

## Relation between Citizen Science and Open Science

All Citizen Science is part of Open Science,
when it produces Open Data [1][2]

- [1] See next slide
- [2] probably in an Open Access journal :-) (but no data)

## Is all citizen science open science?

No, from @groom2017citizen:

| Type of data | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| Open         | 11.4%     |
| Closed       | 0.6%      |
| Unclear      | 88%       |

> n = 12458 citizen science projects

# The importance of Citizen Science

## Qualitative indicators

> Citizen science can help researchers to address previously insolvable problems. @gura2013citizen
>
> Citizen science can also educate and engage @gura2013citizen

## Quantitative indicators

-   Financially
-   Engagement
-   Scholarly
-   Success rate

Back-of-the-envelope calculations!

## The financial impact of Citizen Science

The value of the dataset created:

| Value (M\$) | \# projects | Source              |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1.55        | 7           | @sauermann2015crowd |
| 667-2500    | 388         | @theobald2015global |

## The financial impact of Citizen Science

Assume the dataset value is 2.5 B$ @theobald2015global.

Is that 'a little' or 'a lot'?  Compare to global science budget spending!

> If the value of the data set I create is worth as much as my salary,
> it was worth that salary

## The financial impact of Citizen Science is small

Assuming Citizen Science adds 2.5 B\$:

| Area  | Science budget spending (B\$) | 2.5 B\$ |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------|
| EU    | 408.322 @oecd                 | 0.61%   |
| USA   | 761.582 @oecd                 | 0.33%   |
| World | 1707.221 @oecd                | 0.15%   |

Citizen Science adds 0.15% extra value

## Engagement: how many people are reached?

In 2015, 1.36-2.28 million people volunteer annually @theobald2015global

## Engagement: how many people are reached?

Assume 2.28 million people are reached @theobald2015global

Is that 'a little' or 'a lot'? Compare to the number of scientists!

> When I'd scale up, I expect to reach 100 citizens for it to feel worth it

## Engagement: how many people are reached?

| Year | Parameter         | Value                                   |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2014 | Citizens          | 2.28 million @theobald2015global        |
| 2018 | Scientist density | 1368 per million @unesco2021researchers |
| 2018 | World population  | 7684 million @worldometers              |
| 2018 | Scientists        | 10.51 million                           |

-   There is 1 citizen per 4.6 scientists

## Citizen science is used in few publications @theobald2015global

![Theobald et al., 2015, figure 4](theobald2015global_fig_4.jpg)

## Citizen Science projects resulting in a paper

12% of Citizen Science projects can be linked
to a peer-reviewed paper @theobald2015global.

- Hard to pass peer review?
- Sloppier linking?

## Citizen science results in less papers

| Project type    | Chance project can be linked to a publication |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Citizen Science | 12% @theobald2015global                       |
| Open Access     | 61% @hecker2018european                       |
| Closed access   | 21% @hecker2018european                       |

# Why UNESCO interested?

## Method

Search UNESCO website why Citizen Science is important

-   e.g. <https://eu-citizen.science/>

## Results

Nothing new.

# Number revisited

# Revisited: financial impact

-   0.15% of scientists is a citizen scientist @theobald2015global
-   The world spends 1707.221 M$ on science @oecd
-   Hence, 2.56 B$ of science funding goes to citizen scientists
-   The dataset value created by those is around 2.5 B$ @theobald2015global

> Yes, it is worth it

## Revisited: engagement

-   1 citizen per 4.6 scientists
-   0.15% of scientists is a citizen scientist @theobald2015global
-   Hence, 1 citizen scientist reaches 307 citizens

> Yes, it is worth it

# Conclusions

## Conclusion 1/3

RQ1: What is the relation between Citizen Science and Open Science?

A: Citizen Science is part of Open Science, if it produces Open Data

## Conclusion 2/3

RQ2: How important is Citizen Science?

-   is used in few publications
-   results in less papers per project
-   its financial impact per citizen scientist is big
-   its engagement per scientist is big

## Conclusion 3/3

RQ3: Why is UNESCO interested in it?

-   Can only guess
-   Money?
-   Engagement?
-   Inclusiveness?

## Discussion

- I feel citizen science is worth it. Do you?
- Shallow literature search, around 10 hours: 
  Maybe a substantial effect?
