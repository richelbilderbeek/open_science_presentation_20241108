## Description

The European Union thinks Open Science is important.
One of the facets of its strategic plan is citizen science,
which is using non-scientists in research.
This talk will be about citizen science:
why is citizen science important?
What is its impact?
What evidence do we have for this?
And of course: where and how can a regular citizen help?
